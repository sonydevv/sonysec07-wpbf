wpbf is a bruteforce tool to remotely test password strength, username enumeration and plugin detection on a WordPress site.

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

The script will try to login into the WordPress dashboard through the login form using a mixture of
enumerated usernames, a wordlist and relevant keywords from the blog's content. If a single username is
given, the script will not search for additional usernames.

When a correct username/passwords matchs, it will be logged and show on the standard output.

For faster results you can spawn threads but BE CAREFULL not to flood/DoS the site. Default
settings can be changed in "config.py" and "logging.conf" files.

The wordlist must have one entry per line, a small wordlist (wordlist.txt) and plugin list (plugins.txt) are provided for testing purposes.

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Username enumeration and detection (TALSOFT-2011-0526, Author's archive page and content parsing)
* Threads
* Use keywords from blog's content in the wordlist
* HTTP Proxy Support
* Basic WordPress fingerprint (version and full path)
* Advance plugins fingerprint (bruteforce, discovery and version/documentation)
* Detection of Login LockDown plugin (this plugin makes the bruteforce useless)
* Advanced logging using Python's logging library and logging configuration file

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Python 2.6+ (maybe it runs in older versions, if you want to test please notify me)

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* False positives (in all passwords) with some uncommon WordPress versions or configurations

Usage
^^^^^

wpbf.py [-h] [-w WORDLIST] [-u USERNAME] [-s SCRIPTPATH] [-t THREADS] [-p PROXY] [-nk] [-eu] url

	positional arguments:
	  url                   base URL where WordPress is installed (ex: http://www.myblog.com/)

	optional arguments:
	  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST		        Worldlist file (default: wordlist.txt)
	  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME		        Username (default: enumerate users)
	  -s SCRIPTPATH, --scriptpath SCRIPTPATH	        Relative path to the login form (default: wp-login.php)
	  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS		        How many threads the script will spawn (default: 5)
	  -p PROXY, --proxy PROXY			        HTTP proxy (ex: http://localhost:8008/)

	  -eu, --enumerateusers			        Only enumerate users
	  -eut, --enumeratetolerance ENUMERATETOLERANCE		User ID gap tolerance to use in username enumeration

	  -nk, --nokeywords                                 Skip search for keywords in content for the wordlist
	  -nf, --nofingerprint                              Skip WordPress fingerprint (version/full path)
	  -nps, --nopluginscan                              Skip plugins bruteforce, discovery and fingerprint
	  -ds, --dontstop                                   Don't stop when password is found, continue with all pending tasks

	  --test                                            Run python doctests (you can use a dummy URL here)

For extended help, run "./wpbf.py -h".

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Basic
+++++

It will use the default settings (you can change the default settings in config.py file)::

$ ./wpbf.py http://www.mysite.com/blog/

Custom
++++++

Using username 'john', not using keywords in the wordlist and trough a local proxy::

$ ./wpbf.py --nokeywords -u john -p http://localhost:8008/ http://www.mysite.com/blog/

Aggresive
+++++++++

It will use default settings and spawn 23 threads::

$ ./wpbf.py -t 23 http://www.mysite.com/blog/

Username enumeration
++++++++++++++++++++
Only perform a user enumeration::

$ ./wpbf.py -eu http://www.mysite.com/blog/

Output sample
+++++++++++++
Or how the script will behave in a normal run::

	$ ./wpbf.py http://localhost/wordpress/

	2011-06-18 19:11:56,641 - wpbf - INFO - Password 'qawsed' found for username 'admin' on http://localhost/wordpress/wp-login.php
